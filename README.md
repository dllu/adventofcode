# adventofcode
Here you will find my solutions to Advent of Code problems in a bunch of 
different programming languages.  Rust is my primary language for solving
these challenges, but I will port my solutions to other languages as time
permits.

Why am I doing this?  I have been fascinated with programming languages
for a long time.  Different languages often force us to think about solving
problems using different paradigms, and sometimes, these can lead to
interesting insights.

I don't claim that this code is the most idiomatic way to write code in a
particular language.  I definitely won't be getting many style points for my
efforts.  Experts in these languages will probably cringe at my work, at
times.  However, I guarantee that they do work and that they have passed the
input sets that were assigned to me for the Advent of Code challenges.  Your
mileage may vary, and standard disclaimers apply.

Enjoy.
